# Portfolio Project Front-End (2025)

This is the front-end portfolio site built with **React**. It consumes the REST API I created in Assignment 1 to dynamically display data for my projects and skills.

---

## What I Did

- Built the front-end entirely in **React**
- Used **Axios** to fetch data from my backend API
- Created a structured layout for a professional portfolio
- Displayed data dynamically from `about` and `projects` collections
- Created a contact section with my information
- Fully styled and made responsive using a custom CSS approach
- Deployed the site online

## Live Site

- Frontend URL: (https://portfolio-project-front-end-2025.vercel.app/)

---

## Tech Stack

- React.js (with Vite )
- Axios (for API requests)
- CSS (custom + framework)
- Deployed using Vercel
